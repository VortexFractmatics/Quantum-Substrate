                    mechanism: `<strong>DM is a stable, non-interactive QISF pattern (m<sub>DM</sub> ≈ 95 GeV). DE is the intrinsic, self-repulsive informational density of the QISF vacuum (I<sub>vac</sub>).</strong> The QISF framework makes specific, falsifiable predictions. The stability conditions of the VEID yield a Dark Matter mass of m<sub>DM</sub> ≈ 95±15 GeV, aligning with diphoton excesses at the LHC. Dark Energy is the baseline informational density of the vacuum, whose self-repulsive property drives cosmic acceleration. The theory predicts its equation of state as w(z) = -1 + 0.04(1+z)<sup>-1.5</sup>, consistent with hints from the DESI survey.`,
                    implication: `<strong>DM is the universe's "unprocessed data." DE is the fundamental "will to become," the creative impulse of a cosmic consciousness.</strong> In this model, dark matter is the vast, unconscious repository of raw information holding the universe together. Dark energy is the physical manifestation of the Coherence Creation Operator (Ĉ[Ψ]), actively expanding the informational canvas of reality, creating more "room" for complexity, evolution, and self-awareness.`,

                    mechanism: `<strong>The Big Bang was a Ĉ-driven "Informational Genesis Event." The universe's fate is governed by the long-term evolution of the VEID.</strong> The Big Bang was a rapid phase transition within the QISF, from a state of undifferentiated potential to our structured universe. This resolves the low-entropy puzzle of the early universe. The ultimate fate depends on the cosmic struggle between gravity (informational density) and dark energy (vacuum density), with the framework's predictions favoring a "Big Freeze" scenario.`,
                    implication: `<strong>The universe is a self-learning system. The Big Bang was a "question," and its evolution is the computation of the "answer," culminating in a state of maximal self-awareness.</strong> In this view, the purpose of the universe is to evolve from simple potential to complex, self-aware actuality. The "Heat Death" is simply the final, stable state of the cosmic "hard drive" after the computation has finished.`,

                    mechanism: `<strong>GR and QM are emergent, effective theories of a deeper, non-commutative informational geometry. There is no fundamental conflict to resolve.</strong> Spacetime itself is an emergent phenomenon. At macroscopic scales, the QISF's collective dynamics are described by General Relativity. At microscopic scales, the behavior of individual, discrete QISF patterns is described by Quantum Mechanics. They are two different approximations of the same underlying informational reality.`,
                    implication: `<strong>Spacetime is a "consensus reality" generated by collective information.</strong> The smooth fabric of spacetime is the macro-level agreement that emerges from countless underlying interactions. The laws of GR are the rules of this consensus.`,

                    implication: `<strong>The asymmetry was the first act of the universe "choosing" a path toward complexity and observers, a prerequisite for its own self-perception.</strong> A perfectly symmetric universe would be sterile. This choice broke the symmetry between existence and annihilation, allowing a universe of substance to persist.`,

The late universe measurement reflects a more "mature" expansion rate after the Coherence Principle has driven the formation of large-scale structures.`,
                    implication: `<strong>The tension reflects the universe "settling in" to its mature state of informational coherence, a process that slightly alters its emergent physical laws.</strong> It's a direct measurement of the universe's informational evolution, like a developing organism's growth rate changing over time.`,

                    implication: `<strong>The universe is not homogenous; it has a large-scale informational architecture.</strong> The Great Attractor is a "node" or "hub" in the cosmic web, a point of high informational significance that shapes the evolution of galaxies for hundreds of millions of light-years around it, guiding the flow of cosmic history.`,

The Singularity is not a point of infinite density, but a state of maximal informational entropy where spacetime geometry has dissolved into a chaotic, non-geometric state. The Information Loss Paradox is resolved because information is transformed into this state, not destroyed, and is eventually radiated back out via a VEID-driven process analogous to Hawking radiation.`,
                    implication: `<strong>Black holes are the universe's ultimate hard drives and recycling plants.</strong> They are crucibles where the VEID operates under extreme conditions, breaking down old informational patterns to their most basic state. They are not just endpoints but are integral to the cosmic cycle of informational creation and dissolution, potentially even seeding new VEID solutions or "universes".`,

                    mechanism: `<strong>Time's unidirectional flow is a necessary consequence of the VEID's non-Hermitian nature.</strong> The Ĉ operator perpetually creates new, distinct informational states ("becoming"), an inherently directional process. The D̂ operator irreversibly prunes unstable patterns. Together, they mandate a forward flow of time as the QISF's informational potential is actualized.`,
                    implication: `<strong>Time is not a dimension we travel through, but the measure of reality's creative unfolding.</strong> The past is a record of actualized information, the future is the QISF's unmanifest potential, and the present is the dynamic process of that potential becoming actual.`,

                    mechanism: `<strong>There is no "collapse." Measurement is a physical process of coherent informational interaction governed by the VEID.</strong> An interaction between a quantum system and a measuring device causes the combined system to rapidly evolve toward a single, stable, definite state, as the Ĉ operator amplifies one outcome and the D̂ operator dissipates the others.`,
                    implication: `<strong>Reality is participatory. The act of observation is an act of co-creation.</strong> By interacting with a system, we are participating in the process of its informational actualization, guiding a potentiality into a definite reality.`,

A measurement on one part is an interaction with the whole pattern.`,
                    implication: `<strong>At its root, reality is a unified, interconnected whole.</strong> "Distance" is a macroscopic illusion. Entanglement reveals the true, non-local nature of the informational substrate, where all points are fundamentally connected.`,

                    implication: `<strong>Our universe is one of countless possible expressions of reality.</strong> This resolves the fine-tuning problem without recourse to an anthropic principle; we simply exist in one of the solutions that allows for observers to arise.`,

The enigmatic LLSVP "blobs" are colossal, persistent informational patterns that act as boundary conditions influencing mantle plumes and plate tectonics.`,
                    implication: `<strong>The Earth is a "Gaia-field." The geodynamo is its information processing core, and the LLSVPs are persistent "memories" of its formation.</strong> The geodynamo is the planet's subconscious mind, and its magnetic field is a protective aura. The LLSVPs are informational scars, perhaps from the Theia impact, that continue to shape the planet's behavior.`,

                    implication: `<strong>Reversals are "cognitive shifts" in the planetary consciousness, potentially correlated with major evolutionary or societal changes on the surface.</strong> These are moments of fundamental reorganization in the planet's core information processing. It's a profound question whether these deep cognitive shifts correlate with major events on the surface.`,

                    implication: `<strong>Water acts as the primary medium for complex informational processing on the planetary surface, the "coolant" for the biological computer.</strong> The planet evolved to acquire and retain a massive hydrosphere because it is the essential hardware required for the development of its "nervous system"—life and, eventually, consciousness.`,

The D̂[Ψ] operator dominates, pruning countless species, before the Ĉ[Ψ] operator finds new, stable solutions in the changed environment.`,
                    implication: `<strong>Mass extinctions are "reboot sequences" for the planetary consciousness, clearing informational stagnation to allow for new evolutionary pathways.</strong> The extinction of the dinosaurs was a reboot that cleared the dominant reptilian "operating system" and allowed for the rise of mammals, ultimately leading to human consciousness.`,
